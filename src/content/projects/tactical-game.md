## Project Vision

This tactical game prototype explores new mechanics in the puzzle genre, combining strategic planning with quick decision-making.

## Gameplay Features

- **Strategic Depth**: Each level requires careful planning and execution
- **Learning Curve**: Mechanics introduced gradually with tutorial integration
- **Replayability**: Multiple solutions for each level encourage experimentation
- **Progression**: Unlock new mechanics as you advance

## Technical Stack

Built with React Native and Expo for cross-platform deployment:
- Zustand for state management
- React Native Reanimated for smooth animations
- TypeScript for type-safe game logic
- Expo for simplified deployment

## Current Status

Core mechanics complete with 60 levels. Project paused to explore publishing options and potential partnerships.
